### Server Requirements
Your server can have two optional channels:
> **terminal-logs**

**This is used for logs** which can be enabled by doing the command: "logs on". 

> **terminal-reports**

**This is used for reports and tickets**. If there is no reports channel, all tickets and reports will go to the channel the report has taken place in.

If the bot doesn't respond to a certain command, **make sure it has all necessary server permissions.**

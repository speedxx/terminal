# What is terminal?
A Moderation Bot, made for Discord with over 50 commands, which is coded in Java Script. The code is open source, may be used, but please credit to this github.

### Running terminal yourself
Move `config.json` out of the `json` directory into your main directory, after that fill in the token field and run one of the `runbot` files. If done correctly, all commands should load and terminal should boot.

### Default Terminal Prefix

### Server Requirements
Your server can have two optional channels:
> **terminal-logs**

**This is used for logs** which can be enabled by doing the command: "logs on". 

> **terminal-reports**

**This is used for reports and tickets**. If there is no reports channel, all tickets and reports will go to the channel the report has taken place in.

If the bot doesn't respond to a certain command, **make sure it has all necessary server permissions.**
